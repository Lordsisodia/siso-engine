# tasks.yaml - Master list of all planned work
# Managed by: Planner Agent
# Purpose: Full context for all tasks, dependencies, and reasoning
#
# The Planner owns this file. It contains:
# - All tasks identified (planned, ready, blocked, completed)
# - Full reasoning for each task
# - Dependencies between tasks
# - Links to plan documents
#
# The Executor reads from this file for context, but does NOT:
# - Pick tasks from here (reads queue.yaml for that)
# - Modify priorities
# - Add new tasks
