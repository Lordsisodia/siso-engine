## Archive Process

When a hook is superseded:

1. Move hook folder from `pipeline/` or `active/` to `archive/`
2. Update this README with archive reason
3. Link to new implementation
4. Keep for reference (don't delete)

---

## Archive Reasons

- **Superseded** - New version replaces it
- **Deprecated** - No longer needed
- **Merged** - Functionality merged into another hook
- **Failed** - Didn't work, kept for lessons learned
