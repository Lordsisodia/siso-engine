## Issue #1103: [Feature]: Add per-agent control for Studio data reporting

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2026-01-12T07:15:34Z
**URL:** https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues/1103

### Description

## Feature Request: Add per-agent control for Studio data reporting

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

Currently, when AgentScope Studio is connected via `_equip_as_studio_hooks()`, the `as_studio_forward_message_pre_print_hook` is registered as a class-level hook that applies to **all** Agent instances. This causes two main issues:

1. **Performance Impact**: The hook makes a synchronous HTTP request (`requests.post`) to Studio on every `print()` call. This blo...

## Issue #1102: [Feature]: Add support for secure access to Aliyun models in AgentScope

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2026-01-09T08:18:01Z
**URL:** https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues/1102

### Description

# Add support for secure access to Aliyun models in AgentScope

Our system needs to securely access Aliyun model services (e.g., Model Studio) using encryption protocols like TLS and token authentication. According to [Aliyun's documentation](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/encrypted-access-to-model-inference?spm=a2c4g.11186623.help-menu-search-2400256.d_0), encrypted API calls are required for cloud model inference.

## Request

Does AgentScope currently support this secure access patte...

## Issue #1100: feat(middleware): support middleware in agentscope, including agent, tools, and models

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2026-01-09T07:34:09Z
**URL:** https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues/1100

**Labels:** Roadmap

### Description

Hooks only work at pre and post positions. In contrast, middleware should support a wrapper form where the input is a request, allowing operations to be performed around the request in one go.

读取文件的时候,有时候是没有range参数,有时候出现[1-100],显示的肯定是不全的,这个是正常还是bug?

## Issue #1093: refactor(agent): refactor the ReActAgent class to keep code maintainable

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2026-01-08T04:04:45Z
**URL:** https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues/1093

**Labels:** Roadmap

### Description

It's exciting to see more agentic features being integrated into the `ReActAgent` class.

However, while developing the memory compression functionality in #1031, I noticed that the `ReActAgent` class has grown to over 1000 lines. As we continue integrating additional features such as RAG, long-term memory, memory compression, and others, their logic is becoming scattered across different methods, making the codebase increasingly difficult to understand and maintain. Simply adding new methods to...

## Issue #1091: [Bug]:Frequent print messages from stream_printing_messages seem to block consumption when tool-call chunks are large

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2026-01-08T02:14:55Z
**URL:** https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues/1091

### Description

**Describe the bug**
Hi,
While consuming the print messages generated by pipeline stream_printing_messages, I noticed that when the LLM produces a large number of tool-call argument chunks, the print calls become so frequent that they appear to block (or severely throttle) the downstream message consumption, resulting in a noticeable performance drop.
Could this be addressed, e.g. by batching/flushing the prints or making the printing step optional/non-blocking?
Thanks!

**To Reproduce**
1. Run ...

## Issue #1089: [Feature]: Support building agents from an AgentConfig (YAML) file

**State:** OPEN
**Created:** 2026-01-07T10:33:12Z
**URL:** https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope/issues/1089

### Description

Hi all, could AgentScope support an ADK-style AgentConfig approach for constructing agents?

In ADK, agents can be created not only through code, but also directly from YAML configuration files. References:

https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/config/

This is a very convenient workflow: almost anyone can quickly build a multi-agent system this way....
