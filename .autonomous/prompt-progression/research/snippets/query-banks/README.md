# Query Banks (GitHub search prompts, versioned)

Purpose:
- Keep “raw but useful” GitHub search query banks in a committed, discoverable location.
- Prevent valuable query work from getting stranded in `docs/.blackbox/.local/` (gitignored).

Conventions:
- File naming:
  - `github-search-queries-<topic>-vN.md` for iterative versions
  - `github-search-queries-<topic>.md` only when it is truly stable
- Content style:
  - short intent header (what you’re hunting)
  - bullet queries only (copy/paste friendly)

- OSS discovery “lanes” live under: `docs/.blackbox/oss-catalog/lanes/`
