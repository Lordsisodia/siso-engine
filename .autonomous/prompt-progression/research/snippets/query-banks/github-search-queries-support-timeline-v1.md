# GitHub Search Queries — Support timeline + helpdesk primitives (v1)

Goal: find OSS we can reuse for:
- customer timeline / activity feeds (order/return/shipment/support events)
- helpdesk/shared inbox primitives (conversations, tickets, assignments)
- embeddable support widgets or inbox UIs (reference patterns)

Run with `--no-derived-queries` to keep this lane focused.

## Topic-based discovery (high signal)

- `helpdesk`, `ticketing`, `shared-inbox`, `customer-support`, `customer-service`, `livechat`, `chat-widget`, `knowledge-base`

## Helpdesk / shared inbox products (reference implementations)

- `open source helpdesk`
- `shared inbox open source`
- `customer support ticketing open source`
- `open source customer support inbox`

## Customer timeline / activity feed patterns

- `customer timeline open source`
- `activity feed ui component`
- `event timeline ui component react`
- `audit log ui component`

## Support widgets / chat primitives

- `chat widget open source react`
- `live chat widget open source`
