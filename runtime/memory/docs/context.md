# Context (SISO Internal)

This Blackbox belongs to the **SISO-INTERNAL** repo (React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase PWA).

## Primary goal

Operate like a “brain cell team”:

- take a batch of feedback
- group and research it by domain
- produce high-quality handoffs and plans
- implement and verify fixes
- preserve learnings in domain knowledge

## Repo constraints (must follow)

- Mobile-first UI (PWA)
- TypeScript strict mode (avoid `any`)
- Prefer existing patterns over new abstractions
- Supabase is primary backend; RLS and types sync matter
